## About the Course

The Phitron computer fundamentals course provides a comprehensive introduction to programming and essential computer science concepts. The focus areas of this course include:

- Basics of programming in C and C++
- Understanding of core data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, etc.
- Introduction to fundamental algorithms including sorting, searching, and recursion
- Problem-solving techniques and algorithm design principles

## Topics Covered

This repository is structured into different directories, each representing a specific topic or module from the course:

- **C Programming**: Covers topics such as basic syntax, data types, control structures, functions, pointers, and memory management.
- **C++ Programming**: Focuses on object-oriented programming concepts including classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and templates.
- **Data Structures**: Includes implementations of arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more.
- **Algorithms**: Features sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, dynamic programming, and other algorithmic strategies.

## Installation

To run the code examples in this repository, you will need a C/C++ compiler installed on your system. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Install a Compiler**: For Windows, use [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/). Linux and macOS users typically have GCC pre-installed.
